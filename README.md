# GLC (Genetics-Linguistics Correspondence)
>Based on fundamental physical principle, this research can be applied to predict the evolution of sequence, such as protein sequence and human text, generating sequence, and satisfying many statistical hallmarks of life and language, e.g., Zipf's law and power-law degree distribution.

## General Information
- Main spirt - Life and language shared many similar hallmarks, thus they can be analyzed via a general framework.
- Main Problem - The natural selection of sequence has not been quantified. In the other hands, the generating algorithm and prediction of sequence usually lack the $\text{\textcolor{red}{interpretability}}$. 
- This project provides 

(1) an evolutionary algorithm that can generate text/protein sequence; 

(2) tools that can be used to analyze text/protein sequence

## Features
List the ready features here:
- Only need $\text{\textcolor{red}{4 parameters}}$ to generate a sequence that satisfies the statistical properties of human text and protein sequence.
- Awesome feature 2
- Awesome feature 3
